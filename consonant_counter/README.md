This C program counts how many consonant letters are in a sentence you type.
Won't crash if you type a lot, but the array is fixed only to 200.
Checks each letter from A-Z or a-z, and skips the vowel letters.
I find the 'fgets' function easier to use when dealing with sentences.
The 'scanf' gets too complicated at times when it comes to strings, I mostly use it for integers, 1 word strings, or characters.

# C Programming Repository
---
**A collection of C programming language codes and algorithms for learning and reference purposes.**
---
### 📌 About
- This repository contains various C programming examples, from basic to intermediate level, covering different concepts and algorithms.
- I'm actively adding new codes regularly to expand the collection.
---
### 📅 Future Additions
**I plan to add more programs covering:**
- Data structures (Linked lists, stacks, queues)
- Sorting algorithms
- Multidimensional Arrays
- Pass by value and pass by reference functions
- Pointers
- Structs
- More conditional and loop problems
- And some projects I made
- and maybe, binary and linear search algorithms

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
**This is my personal learning repo. While I appreciate suggestions, I’m not currently accepting pull requests.**

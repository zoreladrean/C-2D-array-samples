## Armstrong Number Checker  

This C program checks if a number is an **Armstrong number**.  

### ❓ What's an Armstrong Number?  
A number that equals the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the digit count.  

**Example**:  
`1634` is an Armstrong number because:  
1⁴ + 6⁴ + 3⁴ + 4⁴ = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = _1634_

This C code checks if the number you entered is an Armstrong number or not.
So what's an Armstrong number?
It's a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.
For example: 1634: 1⁴ + 6⁴ + 3⁴ + 4⁴ = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1634
Honestly, this is really easier when done with pen and paper than in code.
But it's a good brain exercise nonetheless.

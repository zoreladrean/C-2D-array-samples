# Word Counter in C
A simple C program that counts the number of words in a given sentence.
-  Demonstrates pointer-based string processing
- The condition in the `countWord()` function skips extra spaces inputted by the user by only counting a *non-space* character.
### example:
`The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog`
```plaintext
   The   quick   brown   fox   jumped   over   the   lazy   dog
```
>these two inputs will both have a number count of 9
